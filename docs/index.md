# Welcome to `juju`

`juju` is a compiler from JAX to MAX graphs. It allows users to write JAX programs, lower those programs to MAX graphs, and execute those graphs on MAX-supported hardware.

## Getting started

If you're just starting out, you probably want to use `juju.jit`. This is an API which allows you to execute JAX compatible Python programs using MAX.

::: juju.jit

::: juju.make_max_graph
